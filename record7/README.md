Record #7, q-code-plugin for java/quarkus development

Open-sourced a Claude Code plugin for Java/Quarkus development.

- https://github.com/crionuke/q-code-plugin

It provides slash commands that instruct Claude to scaffold typical project code and configurations.
Useful for rapid prototyping, iteration, and experimentation.

Initially created commands for typical operations when kicking off a new web/app project. Now expanding it with
commands for common business logic patterns and implementation best practices.
