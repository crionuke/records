Record #5, skills and subagents in claudecode

Behind the marketing, this is just automation of obvious manual work using AI.

Skills: instead of copy-pasting data from some knowledge base by hand, claudecode does it automatically in two steps.
Step 1: based on your prompt and the full list of topics in the knowledge base, it classifies the request and selects
the most relevant topic.
Step 2: it automatically adds the content of this topic into the prompt.

Subagents: instead of opening a new tab, doing research there, and then copying the result back into the original
session, claudecode does this internally. It starts a separate session under the hood and passes back only the final
result.
