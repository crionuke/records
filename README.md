# Chunk #0

Chunks are atomic records of decisions I already paid for.

Each chunk fixes a single observation or choice from real work. No retrospection. No motivation. Only the context
available at the moment of the decision.

Some chunks include code. Some only mark a boundary or a constraint.

This is a decision log, not content.
